### Under Development - Not ready for production use

Aim is to be able to develop virtual DJ plugins in a similar way to the oldschool Quartz Composer plugins.

### Usage

Download the latest release from the releases page and copy the 'VDJTouchEngine.dll' into `C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\VirtualDJ\Plugins64\VideoEffects`

Once loaded add the plugin from the effects menu and click the plus icon to open up the parameters window.

Click the load button to load a tox file.

### Configuring a Tox File

#### Video In
Create a TOP of type In named vdjtexturein. This will be the input texture from virtual DJ.

#### Video Out
Create a TOP of Type Out named vdjtextureout. This will be the output texture to virtual DJ.

#### Audio In
Create a CHOP of type In named vdjaudioin. This will be the input audio from virtual DJ.

#### Audio Out
Create a CHOP of type Out named vdjaudioout. This will be the output audio to virtual DJ.

### To-Do
- Add support for audio buffer injection.
- Add ability for exposing parameters for control through effects panel
- Add support for BPM control
- Add better async file loading support.
